plan:
neural network (numpy)
momentum/nesterov momentum/minibatch sampling
TF: convolution / residual connections / adding noise for regularization / image transformations / adversarial sampling
np convolution
numba convolution for efficiency
recommendation engines

Image processing:
9/23 - Convnet to solve CIFAR-10
9/30 - residual layers (https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781789538205/graphics/assets/665d6bce-6d79-4ee7-9fd3-7d647767a792.png), DAE (optionally a ladder network), adversarial sampling, etc

leveraging pre-trained models (fine tuning, etc)
implement attention transformers
implement transformers in numpy (start)
implement transformers in numpy (finish)


rec engine deployment
ADAM optimization np
RMSPROP optimization np
kaggle-style problem solving
denoising auto encoders (image coloring or noise reduction)
adversarial sampling as regularization
fine-tuning models within bounded constraints

multi-task learning
video processing

RNNs/LSTMs in numpy (needs to be after multi-task learning)
Transformers
face detection (YOLO)

Object tracking
