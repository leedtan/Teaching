plan:
neural network (numpy)
momentum/nesterov momentum/minibatch sampling
TF: convolution / residual connections / adding noise for regularization / image transformations / adversarial sampling
np convolution
recommendation engines
rec engine deployment (aritra)
ADAM optimization np
RMSPROP optimization np
kaggle-style problem solving
denoising auto encoders (image coloring or noise reduction)
adversarial sampling as regularization
fine-tuning models within bounded constraints

multi-task learning
video processing

RNNs/LSTMs in numpy (needs to be after multi-task learning)
Transformers
face detection (YOLO)

Object tracking
